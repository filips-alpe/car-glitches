# Fuel and temperature gauge readings show higher values than actual

Temperature gauge reads around 80-90 when idling (winter, heater on), 110-120 when driving.
Fuel gauge reads around 150% when full, I fill up when the reading falls below 75% to avoid running out of fuel.
Range reported by the trip computer seems correct.

Clue:
This reportedly happened after replacing some electronic part.

Temporary remedy:
Attach a sticker with a recalibrated gauge to the dashboard so that correct readings can be obtained.
